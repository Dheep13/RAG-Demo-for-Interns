### **PART 2: SIMPLIFIED AGENTIC RAG FEATURES**

#### **1. Smart Query Processor** (Simplified Agent)
**Purpose**: Make the RAG system smarter about handling different types of questions

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Detect if query is simple (1 question) or complex (multiple questions)
- Identify question type: "What is...", "How to...", "Compare...", "List..."
- Suggest better search terms if query is too vague
- Break down multi-part questions into separate searches

**Simple Methods to Implement:**
```python
def analyze_query_type(query: str) -> str:
    # Return: "factual", "how-to", "comparison", "list"

def is_complex_query(query: str) -> bool:
    # Check if query has multiple questions or parts

def suggest_better_query(query: str) -> str:
    # Suggest more specific search terms
```

#### **2. Enhanced Search** (Improved Retrieval)
**Purpose**: Make document search more intelligent and comprehensive

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Use existing similarity search as base
- Add simple keyword matching for exact terms
- Combine results from both approaches
- Show confidence scores for each result
- Filter out very low-relevance results

**Simple Methods to Implement:**
```python
def smart_search(query: str, k: int = 5) -> List[Document]:
    # Combine similarity + keyword search

def calculate_relevance_score(query: str, document: str) -> float:
    # Simple relevance scoring

def filter_low_quality_results(results: List) -> List:
    # Remove results below confidence threshold
```

#### **3. Smart Response Generator** (Enhanced Synthesis)
**Purpose**: Generate better, more helpful responses with reasoning

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Use existing RAG response generation as base
- Add simple reasoning steps ("I found this information in...")
- Include confidence level in responses
- Suggest follow-up questions
- Handle cases where no good answer is found

**Simple Methods to Implement:**
```python
def generate_response_with_reasoning(query: str, docs: List) -> dict:
    # Return response + reasoning steps + confidence

def suggest_followup_questions(query: str, response: str) -> List[str]:
    # Generate 2-3 related questions

def handle_no_answer_found(query: str) -> str:
    # Helpful message when no relevant docs found
```

#### **4. Conversation Memory** (Simple Context Management)
**Purpose**: Remember previous questions and provide context-aware responses

**Implementation Tasks:**
- Store last 5-10 conversation turns
- Reference previous questions when relevant
- Handle follow-up questions like "tell me more about that"
- Clear conversation when user starts new topic

**Simple Methods to Implement:**
```python
def add_to_conversation_history(query: str, response: str):
    # Store in session state

def get_conversation_context() -> str:
    # Return recent conversation for context

def is_followup_question(query: str) -> bool:
    # Detect "that", "it", "more details", etc.
```

- Display reasoning steps in expandable sections
- Handle errors gracefully with helpful messages
- Store conversation in Streamlit session state

#### **2. Basic Performance Improvements**
**Tasks:**
- Cache search results for repeated queries using `@st.cache_data`
- Show progress bars for document upload and processing
- Add simple loading spinners for better user experience
